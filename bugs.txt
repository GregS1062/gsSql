X On update "" results in "where" being replaced
X parser is confused when a reserved word ("where") is contained in data
X date should be stored as a single int 20240317 so it can be compared and indexed on,
    however, what to do about a query that asks for all product sold in march, perhaps add
    another int as wholeyear
X store insert
    - missing storename
    - failing to return on custid
X conversion failing
X != not recognised --- because it is an error SQL uses <>
- compare two fields freight > totaldue
X condition alias failing
> select top 25 * from orders where orderdate <> "05/31/2011" and freight > 55.93 and status <> 0  Status condition ignored
X select top 25 o.* from orders o where o.tax > 14000
X select top 25 orderdate from orders
X order by desc not working.
  Delete not working properly  true and false reversed
  Not parseing multiple joins correctly
  Need template columns
  where condition not added to correct join table
  insert (probably) not trimming correctly  like "schiller" works but = "schiller" does not, yet = "jackson" does
  Cannot set field to empty
X  max and min functions broke
   join columns not added to report list
    See select top 50 o.orderid, i.orderid, i.productid from items i join orders o on o.orderid = i.orderid
    but not select top 5 o.orderid, i.orderid, i.productid from orders o join items i on o.orderid = i.orderid
