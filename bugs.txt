X On update "" results in "where" being replaced
X parser is confused when a reserved word ("where") is contained in data
X date should be stored as a single int 20240317 so it can be compared and indexed on,
    however, what to do about a query that asks for all product sold in march, perhaps add
    another int as wholeyear
X store insert
    - missing storename
    - failing to return on custid
X conversion failing
X != not recognised --- because it is an error SQL uses <>
- compare two fields freight > totaldue
X condition alias failing
> select top 25 * from orders where orderdate <> "05/31/2011" and freight > 55.93 and status <> 0  Status condition ignored
X select top 25 o.* from orders o where o.tax > 14000
X select top 25 orderdate from orders
X order by desc not working.
  Delete not working properly  true and false reversed
  Not parseing multiple joins correctly
  Need template columns
