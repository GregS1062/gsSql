Notes on SQL parseing

SQL statements are delimited by
- comma
- open paren 
- close paren 
- keyword
- single space
- single newline
- single tab

if space, newline or tab are encountered, not between quotes, 
    mark as a delimiter and advance to the position prior to the next non-white noise character.

if open or close paren are encounted while a token is being populated
    write the token and decriment the position counter
